# Strawberry Alarm Clock

An alarm clock but with a twist.

Created with React Native, we have set out to build an alarm clock which will ask you what time you would like to be somewhere. With the information, the application will check the traffic and wake you up in line with the day's commute.

# Putting it together

## Starting out - bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

Keen to learn how phone applications work and also questioning the market for a website alarm clock, we researched the different ways to put together such a project.

React Native continually popped up. What seems all the craze, this is a mobile framework which can be used to develop applications for both Android and IOS.

Made over a two weeks, we hit numerous stumbling blocks on our first day. In a conversation with Alice, a coach at Makers, we found out about some of the difficulties building a phone application - especially one which is an alarm. We decided after this that we would start with building the application in Android with a plan to expand to IOS in the future.

When you think about it, an alarm is incredibly intrusive. It requires to work in the background and wants your full attention when its time has come.

This meant getting our head around permissions and inspecting modules written in Android's native language, Java.
